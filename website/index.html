                    My name, as you might have already intuited, is Tommy Hegarty. I am a DevOps engineer at MarginEdge, sometime theater maker, casual writer, and aspiring historian. You can find here some examples of my work and details about my ongoing education. I am currently located in Staunton, Virginia, where I spend my time reading, writing, and talking to my wife and our two cats (usually to the former about the latter).
